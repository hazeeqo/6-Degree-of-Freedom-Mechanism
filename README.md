# 6-Degree-of-Freedom-Mechanism
- developed by Aiman Haziq Shafizam, University of Southampton

The code is being developed for an academic Group Design Project
It is developed using MATLAB App Designer via MATLAB R2022b

The code is created to design a functional GUI to assist the control system for a 6 Degree of Freedom
Mechanical Stimulation Mechanism
